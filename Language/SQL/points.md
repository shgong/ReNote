# Summary

- Write a series of SQL queries using a MySQL database.
- We use MySQL for convenience and knowing standard Ansi SQL is sufficient for the interview.
- The purpose is to ensure you are able to think about problems using a set-based rather than procedural approach.
- We will evaluate you on understanding of fundamental SQL concepts like different types of:
   - Joins (inner, left/right outer, full outer, cross)
   - Nested and Correlated subqueries
   - Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVERAGE and etc)
   - ‘where’ vs ‘having’
   - Handling NULL values
   - Case statements (IF, THEN, ELSE, WHEN and etc)
   - Filters
   - Groupings
   - Rankings
   - Recursive queries
- You’ll also need to verify the results and take care of exceptions and NULL handling
