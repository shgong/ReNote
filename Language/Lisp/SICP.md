## 1 Building Abstractions with Procedures

The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 

1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one
2. Bringing two ideas together, and setting them by one another (to take a view of them at once with all its ideas of relations)
3. Separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence (abstraction)

> John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)

- Computational process, the idea we are about to study
- Lisp, we use for describing processes
    + John McCarthy 1960, AI Group of MIT Research
    + Lisp is for List Processing
    + Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine
- Why using Lisp
    + the language possess unique feature making it execellent medium 
        * for studying important programming constructs & data structures
        * for relating them to linguistic features 
    + most significant feature: Lisp procedures (descriptions of process) can themselves be represented and manipulated as Lisp data
        * blur passive data & active process

### 1.1 The Elements of Programming 

- Every powerful language has three mechanisms to combine ideas
    + primitive expressions
    + means of combination
    + means of abstraction

#### 1.1.1 Expressions
Explore interpreter for Scheme dialect of Lisp

```lisp
( + 137 349)            ;486
(* 5 99)                ;495
(+ 21 35 12 7)          ;75
(+ (* 3 5) (- 10 6))    ;19
```

- Prefix Notation: convention of placing operator to the left
- Advantages 
    + can accommodate procedures take arbitrary number of arguments
    + easy to extend, allow nested combinations 

#### 1.1.2 Naming and the Environment 

```lisp
(define pi 3.14159)
(define radius 10)
(* pi (* radius radius))                ;314.159
(define circumference (* 2 pi radius)) 
circumference                           ;62.8318
```

- `define` is our language's simplest means of abstraction
- interpreter will keep track of name-object pairs in memory, aka environment

#### 1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations 

- in evaluating ocmbinations, interpreter follow a procedures
    + evaluate subexpressions of the combination
    + apply procedure (leftmost operator) to arguments (the other operands)
- stipulations
    + values of numerals are numbers
    + values of built-in operators are machine instruction sequences
    + values of other names are objects associated in environment
        - the role of environment
        - it is meaningless to speak of `(+ x 1)` without specify meaning of `x`
- special forms (exception of general rule)
    + Define: `(define x 3)` does not apply `define` to two arguments

#### 1.1.4 Compound Procedures

```lisp
(define (square x) (* x x))
; (define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>)

(define (sum-of-squares x y)
  (+ (square x) (square y)))
(sum-of-squares 3 4) ;25
(define (f a)
  (sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2)))
(f 5) ;136
```

#### 1.1.5 The Substitution Model for Procedure Application 

- To apply a compound procedure to arguments, evaluate the body of the procedure with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding argument.
- The purpose of the substitution is to help us think about procedure application, not to provide a description of how the interpreter really works.
- The substitution model is only the first of these models -- a way to get started thinking formally about the evaluation process.

```lisp
(f 5)
(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))
(+ (square 6) (square 10))
(+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10))
(+ 36 100)
```

##### Applicative order versus Normal order

another evaluation model:  not evaluate the operands until their values were needed
```lisp
(f 5)
(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))
(+    (square (+ 5 1))    (square (* 5 2))  )
(+    (* (+ 5 1) (+ 5 1)) (* (* 5 2) (* 5 2)))
(+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10))
(+ 36 100)
```

- normal-order evaluation: full expand & reduce 

- applicative-order evaluation: evaluate arguments then apply
    + lisp actually used
    + avoid multiple evaluation of (+ 5 1)
    + normal order become much more complicated

#### 1.1.6 Conditional Expressions and Predicates

case analysis: `cond`
```lisp
( define (abs x)
    (cond ((< x 0) x)
          ((= x 0) 0)
          ((< x 0) (- x)))

; predicate: first expression in each pair
; if first predicate is false, second is evaluated

(define (abs x)
    (cond ((< x 0) (- x))
    (else x)))
; else for default value

(define (abs x)
    (if (< x 0) (- x) x))
; when there are only two cases
```

- logic compounds
    + (and x y)  
    + (or x y)
    + (not x)

#### 1.1.7 Example: Square Roots by Newtonâ€™s Method 

square root
```lisp
(define (sqrt x)
    ( the y (and (>= y 0)
                 (= (square y) x)))


(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
```

exercises...

#### 1.1.8 Procedures as Black-Box Abstractions
 
 - decomposition strategy
     + not simply dividing program into parts
     + we can regard other procedure as black box
- local names
    + procedure implementation should not matter to names
    + If the parameters were not local to the bodies of their respective procedures, then the parameter x in square could be confused with the parameter x in good-enough?
- internal definitions and block structure
